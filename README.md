# Inspiration
Imagine this: you are at an event with your best friends and want some great jams to play. However, you have no playlist on hand that represents this energy-filled moment. After several years of struggling to find the perfect playlist for various occasions, we finally developed a solution to meet all needs.

# What it does
Mixr solves this problem by generating custom playlists based on a short questionnaire which inquires about your current mood and environment. Using this information in combination with your Spotify listening habits, Mixr synthesizes a playlist that is perfect for the moment.

# How we built it
We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in combination with an Express server and the Spotify API.
